# HOW_TO_GO
PUSAN NATL' UNIV 3-1 ANDROID PROJECT

IN 2017

IT IS TO FIND PATHS BETWEEN MANY PLACES(MAX 5).
YOU CAN SEE THE CLOSEST PATHWAY / THE SHORTEST TIME BY TRANSPORTATION, AND THE CHEAPEST COST / THE SHORTEST TIME BY CAR.
YOU CAN SAVE PATHWAY YOU CHOOSE, DELETE IT FROM THE SAVED LIST.
USING T MAP API - NOW IT IS NOT FREE AND NOT WORKED. 
                  IF YOU WANT USE IT, YOU NEED TO PAY FOR IT. I RECOMMAND USE OTHER SEARCH API.
